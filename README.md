# growtopia-save-storage
An app to help you switch between growtopia accounts with ease

This app will help you change between accounts via moving save.dat files between your growtopia folder, and a storage folder.

You can store as many save.dat as you want in the storage, and swap between accounts with the press of a button.

"Save" Page: This page allows you to only save the save.dat file in your growtopia folder to the storage with the name you desire.

"Storage" Page: This page allows you to see every save you have stored, "activate" a save which moves the save you want back
to the growtopia folder, as well as "swap" between save.dat files, which moves the save you want to the growtopia folder
and automatically moving the save.dat which already was in the growtopia folder to the storage.
(NOTE: Since swapping these files AUTOMATICALLY renames the save.dat file when moving to the storage, you first HAVE TO activate
a save at least ONCE, so that the app saves the name of the active save!!)

"Settings" Page: This is a basic page which has you enter the paths of your growtopia folder, as well as the storage folder.
